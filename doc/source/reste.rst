Source steps
------------

Source steps provide input files for the pipeline, such as RNA sequences.

Run folder source
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here's an example:

.. code-block:: yaml

    - run_folder_source: { path: in }

This source looks for fastq.gz files in 
``[path]/Unaligned/Project_*/Sample_*`` and pulls additional information from 
CSV sample sheets it finds. 
It also makes sure that index information for all samples is coherent and 
unambiguous.

FASTQ source
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here's an example:

.. code-block:: yaml

    - fastq_source:
        pattern: /data/original-fastq/&#42;.fastq.gz
        group: (Sample_COPD_\d+)_R[12].fastq.gz
        indices: copd-barcodes.csv

Input files are collected as defined by ``pattern`` and grouped into samples 
according to ``group``, which is a regular expression. 
All groups defined in the regex ``(  )`` are used to construct the sample 
name, here it is used to declare that both R1 and R2 files belong to the 
same sample. 
Indices are read from the CSV file specified by ``indices``.
