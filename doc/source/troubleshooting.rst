.. title:: Post-Mortem Analysis

..
  This document describes how-to analyse problems that occured while using
  **uap** and how-to find the cause of the problem.

Post-mortem pipeline analysis

Upon successful completion of a task, an extensive YAML-formatted annotation 
is placed next to the output files in a file called 
``.[task_id]-annotation.yaml``.
Also, for every output file, a symbolic link to this file is created:
``.[output_filename].annotation.yaml``.

Finally, the annotation is rendered via GraphViz, if available.
Rendering can also be done at a later time using annotations as input.
The annotation can be used to determine at a later time what exactly happened.
Also, annotations may help to identify bottlenecks.
