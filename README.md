# uap -- Universal Analysis Pipeline

The **uap** package is a framework to configure, run, and control
large data multi-step analyses.
Its main focus is on the analysis of high-throughput sequencing data.

The aim of this data processing pipeline is to enable robust and straightforward
bioinformatics data evaluation.
It is implemented in Python, runs under GNU/Linux and can be controlled from the
command-line interface.
Although the primary focus is the evaluation of sequencing data, its design
allows for a variety of other applications.


# Documentation

The documentation of **uap** is available as [Giltab Page](https://onebutton.ribogitpages.izi.fraunhofer.de/uap/).

# Local Testing

In order to use the testing repo [uap_test](https://ribogit.izi.fraunhofer.de/oneButton/uap_test)
you can use the submodule with `git submodule update --init --recursive`. The tests will be in
the `uap_test` folder.
